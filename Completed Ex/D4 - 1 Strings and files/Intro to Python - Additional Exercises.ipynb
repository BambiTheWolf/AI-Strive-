    "**Exercise 2.2 (optional):** Write code that classifies a given amount of money (which you store in a variable `amount`), specified in cents, as greater monetary units. Your code lists the monetary equivalent in dollars (100 ct), quarters (25 ct), dimes (10 ct), nickels (5 ct), and pennies (1 ct). Your program should report the maximum number of dollars that fit in the amount, then the maximum number of quarters that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars, then the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars and quarters, and so on for nickels and pennies. The result is that you express the amount as the minimum number of coins needed.  \n",

Write a function that calculates the factorial of its (integer) parameter. Test your function for different parameter values, but do not use very large numbers as factorials grow exponentially. Hint: to do this with a `while` loop, you need at least one more variable."
